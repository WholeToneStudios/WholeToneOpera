#WholeTone Opera website

This website I designed and made for the opera I'm producing in February 2016. We needed a site to go up quickly before we handed out promotional materials, so I used [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) to give me a quick, clean framework and mobile-friendly site. I wanted a darker color scheme to fit with the zombie production that we're doing. I hope to continue to add to it as the company grows and we need more presence and resources.
